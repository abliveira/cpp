Every object in C++ has access to its own address through a called this
pointer. The this pointer is an implicit parameter to all member functions.
Inside a member function, this maybe used to refer to the invoking object.

Friend functions do not have a this pointer, because friends are not
members of a class. Only member functions have a this pointer.

It is important to know how objects look at functions and data members of
a class: Each object gets its own copy of data members and all objects share
a single copy of member functions.

So, to  proper access and updated data members are accessed, the compiler 
supplies an implicit pointer along with the names of the functions as ‘this’.

The ‘this’ pointer is passed as a hidden argument to all nonstatic member function 
calls and is available as a local variable within the body of all nonstatic 
functions. ‘this’ pointer is not available in static member functions as 
static member functions can be called without any object (with class name).

For a class X, the type of this pointer is ‘X* ‘. Also, if a member function 
of X is declared as const, then the type of this pointer is ‘const X *’

You may be wondering why it's necessary to use the this keyword,
when you have the option of directly specifying the variable.
The this keyword has an important role in operator overloading.

Following are the situations where ‘this’ pointer is used:
1) When local variable’s name is same as member’s name
2) To return reference to the calling object
